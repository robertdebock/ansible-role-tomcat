=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robertdebock/ansible-role-tomcat.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robertdebock/ansible-role-tomcat)

The purpose of this role is to install and configure tomcat on your system.

Example Playbook
----------------

This example is taken from `molecule/default/playbook.yml`:
```
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: true
  gather_facts: false

  roles:
    - robertdebock.bootstrap
    - robertdebock.java
    - robertdebock.tomcat

```

Role Variables
--------------

These variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```
---
# defaults file for tomcat

# The explicit version to use when referring to the short name.
tomcat_version7: 7.0.91
tomcat_version8: 8.0.53
tomcat_version85: 8.5.34
tomcat_version9: 9.0.12

# The location where to download Apache Tomcat from.

# Some "sane" defaults.
tomcat_name: tomcat
tomcat_directory: /opt
tomcat_version: 8.5
tomcat_user: tomcat
tomcat_group: tomcat
tomcat_xms: 512M
tomcat_xmx: 1024M
tomcat_non_ssl_connector_port: 8080
tomcat_ssl_connector_port: 8443
tomcat_shutdown_port: 8005
tomcat_ajp_port: 8009

# This role allows multiple installations of Apache Tomcat, each in their own
# location, potentially of different version.
# This is done by defining a "tomcat_instances" where "name:" is a unique
# identifier of an instance.
# The default tomcat_instances is one instance using the defaults described
# in defaults/main.yml.
tomcat_instances:
  - name: "{{ tomcat_name }}"
    directory: "{{ tomcat_directory }}"
    version: "{{ tomcat_version }}"
    user: "{{ tomcat_user }}"
    group: "{{ tomcat_group }}"
    xms: "{{ tomcat_xms }}"
    xmx: "{{ tomcat_xmx }}"
    non_ssl_connector_port: "{{ tomcat_non_ssl_connector_port }}"
    ssl_connector_port: "{{ tomcat_ssl_connector_port }}"
    shutdown_port: "{{ tomcat_shutdown_port }}"
    ajp_port: "{{ tomcat_ajp_port }}"

# When downloading wars, should the SSL certificate be valid? (Impossible for
# CentOS 6, so default: no.)
tomcat_validate_certs: no

# Some Docker containers do not allow managing services, rebooting and writing
# to some locations in /etc. The role skips tasks that will typically fail in
# Docker. With this parameter you can tell the role to -not- skip these tasks.
tomcat_ignore_docker: yes

```
